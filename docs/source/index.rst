XArray-Histogram documentation
==============================

This package allow to compute histograms from XArray data, taking advantage of its label and dimensions management.
It relies on the `Boost Histogram <https://boost-histogram.readthedocs.io>`_ library for the computations.

It is essentially a thin wrapper using directly Boost Histogram on loaded data, or `Dask-histogram <https://dask-histogram.readthedocs.io>`__ on data contained in dask arrays. It thus features optimised performance, as well as lazy computation and easy up-scaling thanks to dask.
